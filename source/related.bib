  abstract = {Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic neuromuscular disorders that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscles over time, influencing 1 in 3500--5000 children worldwide. New and exciting treatment options have led to a critical need for a clinical post-marketing surveillance tool to confirm the efficacy and safety of these treatments after individuals receive them in a commercial setting. For MDs, functional gait assessment is a common approach to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments because muscle weakness is reflected in individuals' walking patterns. However, there is little incentive for the family to continue to travel for such assessments due to the lack of access to specialty centers. While various existing sensing devices, such as cameras, force plates, and wearables can assess gait at home, they are limited by privacy concerns, area of coverage, and discomfort in carrying devices, which is not practical for long-term, continuous monitoring in daily settings. In this study, we introduce a novel functional gait assessment system using ambient floor vibrations, which is non-invasive and scalable, requiring only low-cost and sparsely deployed geophone sensors attached to the floor surface, suitable for in-home usage. Our system captures floor vibrations generated by footsteps from patients while they walk around and analyzes such vibrations to extract essential gait health information. To enhance interpretability and reliability under various sensing scenarios, we translate the signal patterns of floor vibration to pathological gait patterns related to MD, and develop a hierarchical learning algorithm that aggregates insights from individual footsteps to estimate a person's overall gait performance. When evaluated through real-world experiments with 36 subjects (including 15 patients with MD), our floor vibration sensing system achieves a 94.8\% accuracy in predicting functional gait stages for patients with MD. Our approach enables accurate, accessible, and scalable functional gait assessment, bringing MD progressive tracking into real life.},

Recent crowd-crushing incidents (e.g., the Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster) have caused 100+ deaths, calling for advancements in crowd-monitoring methods. Existing monitoring approaches include manual observation, wearables, video-, audio-, and WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy.In this paper, we introduce a novel crowd monitoring method that leverages floor vibrations to infer crowd reactions (e.g., clapping) and traffic (i.e., the number of people entering) in sports stadiums. Our method allows continuous crowd monitoring in a privacy-friendly and cost-effective way. Unlike monitoring one person, crowd monitoring involves a large population, leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we bring in the context of crowd behaviors, including (1) temporal context to inform crowd reactions to the highlights of the game and (2) spatial context to inform crowd traffic in relation to the facility layouts. We deployed our system at Stanford Maples Pavilion and Michigan Stadium for real-world evaluation, which shows a 14.7\% and 12.5\% error reduction compared to the baseline methods without the context information.},

However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients, especially the elderly or young children. This paper presents FreePulse, a heart rate monitoring system for seated subjects using ambient vibrations. FreePulse builds on our past work using vibrations in the building structures around us to measure human activities and health. As people's hearts beat, they push on the surfaces the body is touching, creating vibrations in those structures. We combine structure response characterization with human pulse modelling to identify these pulse-induced vibrations from ambient vibration. In testing, FreePulse has shown up to 96\% pulse rate accuracy on average, competitive with consumer-grade wearable devices.},

  abstract = {Heart rate is one of the most critical metrics for human health. Most common methods for measuring human heart rate involve body contact, whether from wearable devices or manual measurement. However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients. Past work for non-contact or remote heart rate measurement (e.g., camera or radio) is often limited by line-of-sight requirements that are not always possible in the real-world environment.This paper presents FloHR, an indirect heart rate monitoring system for human beings using heartbeat-induced floor vibrations. The key insight is that the human body generates a small wave of pressure and sound with each heartbeat. These are propagated as vibration through the structures the person is in contact with (e.g., a chair) and through the floor. FloHR then detects and interprets these small floor vibrations. We developed a highly sensitive vibration sensing system and heartbeat pattern modelling to identify these tiny vibrations among other body motions and ambient noise.We evaluated FloHR in a real home environment, demonstrating an average heart rate error similar to medical device standards on the floor near the subjects' chair, and on the order of 10 beats per minute (bpm) on the floor 2 meters away from the subject.},

  abstract = {Crowd monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the behavior of large groups of people in large-scale public spaces, such as sports games. In sports stadiums, understanding audience reactions to the games and their distribution around the public facilities is important for ensuring public safety and security, enhancing the game experience, and improving crowd management. Recent crowd-crushing incidents (e.g., Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster, Seoul Halloween Stampede) have caused 100+ deaths in a single event, calling for advancements in crowd monitoring methods. Existing monitoring approaches include manual observation, wearables, video-, audio-, and WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GameVibes, a novel method for crowd behavior monitoring using crowd-induced floor vibrations to infer audience reactions to the game (e.g., clapping, stomping, dancing) and crowd traffic (i.e., the number of people entering each door). The main benefits of GameVibes are that it allows continuous, fine-grained crowd monitoring in a cost-effective and non-intrusive way and is perceived as more privacy-friendly. Unlike monitoring an individual person, crowd monitoring involves understanding the overall behavior of a large population (typically more than 1,000), leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we first establish the game and facility association to inform the context of crowd behaviors, including 1) game associations (temporal context) between the crowd reaction and the game progress and 2) facility associations (spatial context) between the crowd traffic and facility layouts. Then, we formulate the crowd monitoring problem by converting the conceptual graph of the audience-game-facility association into probabilistic game/facility association models. Through these models, GameVibes first learns the latent representations of the game progress and facility layout through neural network encoders, and then integrates heterogeneous game/facility information and vibration data to estimate crowd behaviors. This mitigates the estimation error due to the uncertainty in vibration data. To evaluate our approach, we conduct 6 real-world deployments for NCAA Pac-12 games at Stanford Maples Pavilion. Our results show that GameVibes achieves a 0.9 F-1 score in crowd reaction monitoring and 9.3 mean absolute error in crowd traffic estimation, which correspond to 10\% and 12.2\% error reduction, respectively, compared to the baseline methods without context-specific information.},

This is especially crucial during the farrowing period, where mother sows and their newborn piglets are housed together to facilitate nursing. Existing weight measurement methods, however, either provide only sporadic snapshots or have scalability and reliability issues in the harsh environment of industrial farms. This paper presents MassHog, a multi-layered system for ubiquitous weight measurement in harsh environments, such as pig pens, using structural vibrations. MassHog combines an existing sensor concept with actuated vibrations to weigh both piglets and adult hogs together. We evaluate the components of this system through testing deployments, including at real-world operating pig farms. Preliminary results show less than 2 kg mean absolute error for adult hogs.},

  abstract = {Precision Swine Farming has the potential to directly benefit swine health and industry profit by automatically monitoring the growth and health of pigs. We introduce the first system to use structural vibration to track animals, and the first system for automated characterization of piglet group activities, including nursing, sleeping, and active times. PigSense uses physical knowledge of the structural vibration characteristics caused by pig-activity-induced load changes to recognize different behaviors of the sow and piglets. In order for our system to survive the harsh environment of the farrowing pen for three months, we designed simple, durable sensors for physical fault tolerance, then installed many of them, pooling their data to achieve algorithmic fault tolerance even when some do stop working. The key focus of this work was to create a robust system that can withstand challenging environments, has limited installation and maintenance requirements, and uses domain knowledge to precisely detect a variety of swine activities in noisy conditions while remaining flexible enough to adapt to future activities and applications. We provided an extensive analysis and evaluation of all-round swine activities and scenarios from our 1-year field deployment across two pig farms in Thailand and the USA. To help assess the risk of crushing, farrowing sicknesses, and poor maternal behaviors, PigSense achieves an average of 97.8\% and 94\% for sow posture and motion monitoring, respectively, and an average of 96\% and 71\% for ingestion and excretion detection. To help farmers monitor piglet feeding, starvation, and illness, PigSense achieves an average of 87.7\%, 89.4\%, and 81.9\% in predicting different levels of nursing, sleeping, and being active, respectively. In addition, we show that our monitoring of signal energy changes allows the prediction of farrowing in advance, as well as status tracking during the farrowing process and on the occasion of farrowing issues. Furthermore, PigSense also predicts the daily pattern and weight gain in the lactation cycle with 89\% accuracy, a metric that can be used to monitor the piglets' growth progress over the lactation cycle.},

  abstract = {Pig vital sign monitoring (e.g., estimating the heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR)) is essential to understand the stress level of the sow and detect the onset of parturition. It helps to maximize peri-natal survival and improve animal well-being in swine production. The existing approach mainly relies on manual measurement, which is labor-intensive and only provides a few points of information. Other sensing modalities such as wearables and cameras are developed to enable more continuous measurement, but are still limited due to animal discomfort, data transfer, and storage challenges. In this paper, we introduce PigV2, the first system to monitor pig heart rate and respiratory rate through ground vibrations. Our approach leverages the insight that both heartbeat and respiration generate ground vibrations when the sow is lying on the floor. We infer vital information by sensing and analyzing these vibrations. The main challenge in developing PigV2 is the overlap of vital- and non-vital-related information in the vibration signals, including pig movements, pig postures, pig-to-sensor distances, and so on. To address this issue, we first characterize their effects, extract their current status, and then reduce their impact by adaptively interpolating vital rates over multiple sensors. PigV2 is evaluated through a real-world deployment with 30 pigs. It has 3.4\% and 8.3\% average errors in monitoring the HR and RR of the sows, respectively.},

While there have been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision, RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6\% accuracy in distinguishing five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings beyond shopping centers.},

Monitoring the activity of the sows helps farmers detect stress, sickness and signs of farrowing, which enables the farmers to provide timely care. Prior work in swine monitoring frequently uses video cameras, which have lighting and large storage and processing requirements. Alternatively, other work has used wearable sensors, which have limited longevity due to durability and battery requirements and suffer from scalability challenges due to the need for individual sensors worn by each sow. The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of geophone sensors mounted under the floor that measure the structural vibration of a farrowing pen to determine posture changes and animal feeding activity. A total of 6 farrowing/lactating sows and litters have been used in these studies. The data were collected from a minimum of 3 days before farrowing to approximately 25 days post-farrow. Up to five geophones were used for activity classification. Machine learning classification methods are used to detect the position and feeding activity of the sow and her piglets, including tree classifiers and principal component analysis. Accuracies of over 95\% were achieved in sow posture and feeding activity classification, indicating the potential of monitoring  ground vibration as a source of health information.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of human gait is critical for the early discovery, progressive tracking, and rehabilitation of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and cerebral palsy. Gait analysis typically involves estimating gait characteristics, such as spatiotemporal gait parameters and gait health indicators (e.g., step time, length, symmetry, and balance). Traditional methods of gait analysis involve the use of cameras, wearables, and force plates but are limited in operational requirements when applied in daily life, such as direct line-of-sight, carrying devices, and dense deployment. This paper introduces a novel approach for gait analysis by passively sensing floor vibrations generated by human footsteps using vibration sensors mounted on the floor surface. Our approach is low-cost, non-intrusive, and perceived as privacy-friendly, making it suitable for continuous gait health monitoring in daily life. Our algorithm estimates various gait parameters that are used as standard metrics in medical practices, including temporal parameters (step time, stride time, stance time, swing time, double-support time, and single-support time), spatial parameters (step length, width, angle, and stride length), and extracts gait health indicators (cadence/walking speed, left--right symmetry, gait balance, and initial contact types). The main challenge we addressed in this paper is the effect of different floor types on the resultant vibrations. We develop floor-adaptive algorithms to extract features that are generalizable to various practical settings, including homes, hospitals, and eldercare facilities. We evaluate our approach through real-world walking experiments with 20 adults with 12,231 labeled gait cycles across concrete and wooden floors. Our results show 90.5\% (RMSE 0.08s), 71.3\% (RMSE 0.38m), and 92.3\% (RMSPE 7.7\%) accuracy in estimating temporal, spatial parameters, and gait health indicators, respectively.},

  abstract = {Gait abnormality detection is critical for the early discovery and progressive tracking of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Cerebral Palsy. Especially, analyzing the foot-floor contacts during walking provides important insights into gait patterns, such as contact area, contact force, and contact time, enabling gait abnormality detection through these measurements. Existing studies use various sensing devices to capture such information, including cameras, wearables, and force plates. However, the former two lack force-related information, making it difficult to identify the causes of gait health issues, while the latter has limited coverage of the walking path. In this study, we leverage footstep-induced structural vibrations to infer foot-floor contact profiles and detect gait abnormalities. The main challenge lies in modeling the complex force transfer mechanism between the foot and the floor surfaces, leading to difficulty in reconstructing the force and contact profile during foot-floor interaction using structural vibrations. To overcome the challenge, we first characterize the floor vibration for each contact type (e.g., heel, midfoot, and toe contact) to understand how contact forces and areas affect the induced floor vibration. Then, we leverage the time-frequency response spectrum resulting from those contacts to develop features that are representative of each contact type. Finally, gait abnormalities are detected by comparing the predicted foot-floor contact force and motion with the healthy gait. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a real-world walking experiment with 8 subjects. Our approach achieves 91.6\% and 96.7\% accuracy in predicting contact type and time, respectively, leading to 91.9\% accuracy in detecting various types of gait abnormalities, including asymmetry, dragging, and midfoot/toe contacts.},

Among these, emotion recognition holds great potential for improving smart buildings by enabling mental health monitoring and human-centric services. Existing emotion recognition approaches use cameras, wearables, and mobile devices to capture people's changing gait patterns under various emotional states. However, these approaches come with corresponding drawbacks, such as being limited by visual obstructions and requiring users to carry devices that cause discomfort. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a new emotion recognition approach using footstep-induced structural vibration signals. The main intuition of this approach is that people's gait patterns change under various emotions [1], thus inducing distinct structural vibration patterns as they walk. Compared to other methods, our approach is non-intrusive, insensitive to visual obstructions, and has fewer perceived-privacy concerns. The main research challenge in developing our approach is that emotions have both explicit and implicit effects on gait, making the explicit gait parameters insufficient to describe such a complex relationship. To this end, we develop a set of emotionsensitive features from the vibration signals, including gait parameters, sequential features, and time-frequency spectrum features to capture both the explicit and implicit effects of emotion on gait. To better integrate multiple types of features, we develop the fully-connected layer, the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) layer, and the convolutional layer to extract information from the features and a multilayer perceptron to estimate emotion. Our approach is evaluated in a real-world walking experiment involving 5 participants with over 100 minutes of footstep-induced floor vibration signals. Our results show that our approach achieves a mean absolute error of 1.33 for valence score estimation and 1.26 for arousal score estimation out of an overall score range of 1 to 9, which has an accuracy of 72\% for High / Low valence classification and 82\% for High / Low arousal for emotion classification.},

  abstract = {We present FootprintID, an indoor pedestrian identification system that utilizes footstep-induced structural vibration to infer pedestrian identities for enabling various smart building applications. Previous studies have explored other sensing methods, including vision-, RF-, mobile-, and acoustic-based methods. They often require specific sensing conditions, including line-of-sight, high sensor density, and carrying wearable devices. Vibration-based methods, on the other hand, provide easy-to-install sparse sensing and utilize gait to distinguish different individuals. However, the challenge for these methods is that the signals are sensitive to the gait variations caused by different walking speeds and the floor variations caused by structural heterogeneity.We present FootprintID, a vibration-based approach that achieves robust pedestrian identification. The system uses vibration sensors to detect footstep-induced vibrations. It then selects vibration signals and classifiers to accommodate sensing variations, taking step location and frequency into account. We utilize the physical insight on how individual step signal changes with walking speeds and introduce an iterative transductive learning algorithm (ITSVM) to achieve robust classification with limited labeled training data. When trained only on the average walking speed and tested on different walking speeds, FootprintID achieves up to 96\% accuracy and a 3X improvement in extreme speeds compared to the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, it achieves up to 90\% accuracy (1.5X improvement) in uncontrolled experiments.},

Many ubiquitous computing and building maintenance systems require fine-grained occupancy knowledge to enable occupant centric services and optimize space and energy utilization. The sensing infrastructure support for current occupancy estimation systems often requires multiple intrusive sensors per room, resulting in systems that are both costly to deploy and difficult to maintain. To address these shortcomings, we developed BOES. BOES utilizes sparse vibration sensors to track occupancy levels and activities. Our system has three major components. 1) It extracts features that distinguish occupant activities from noise prone ambient vibrations and detects human footsteps. 2) Using a sequence of footsteps, the system localizes and tracks individuals by observing changes in the sequences. It uses this tracking information to identify when an occupant leaves or enters a room. 3) The entering and leaving room information are combined with detected individual location information to update the room-level occupancy state of the building. Through validation experiments in two different buildings, our system was able to achieve 99.55\% accuracy for event detection, less than three feet average error for localization, and 85\% accuracy in occupancy counting.},

  abstract = {Using geophones to sense bed vibrations caused by ballistic force has shown great potential in monitoring a person's heart rate during sleep. It does not require a special mattress or sheets, and the user is free to move around and change position during sleep. Earlier work has studied how to process the geophone signal to detect heartbeats when a single subject occupies the entire bed. In this study, we develop a system called VitalMon, aiming to monitor a person's respiratory rate as well as heart rate, even when she is sharing a bed with another person. In such situations, the vibrations from both persons are mixed together. VitalMon first separates the two heartbeat signals, and then distinguishes the respiration signal from the heartbeat signal for each person. Our heartbeat separation algorithm relies on the spatial difference between two signal sources with respect to each vibration sensor, and our respiration extraction algorithm deciphers the breathing rate embedded in amplitude fluctuation of the heartbeat signal. We have developed a prototype bed to evaluate the proposed algorithms. A total of 86 subjects participated in our study, and we collected 5084 geophone samples, totaling 56 hours of data. We show that our technique is accurate -- its breathing rate estimation error for a single person is 0.38 breaths per minute (median error is 0.22 breaths per minute), heart rate estimation error when two persons share a bed is 1.90 beats per minute (median error is 0.72 beats per minute), and breathing rate estimation error when two persons share a bed is 2.62 breaths per minute (median error is 1.95 breaths per minute). By varying sleeping posture and mattress type, we show that our system can work in many different scenarios.},

In this paper, we present VVRRM, an ambient heartbeat monitoring system in an automobile which uses a set of accelerometers in a car seat to monitor a subject's heart RR-intervals. The system removes high energy motion noise and periodic noise using a combination of peak detection with extracted wavelet coefficients. Furthermore, it tracks human heart locations through sensor selection to maximize the heart signal energy. We tested the system with both a manufactured heartbeat signal and experiments with human subjects.

Heart rate monitoring can be used to enhance athletic training and assess risk for several health conditions, such as cardiovascular risk and Parkinson's Disease. Many solutions have been proposed to track people's heart rates in their daily lives, but none of them follow the user around without requiring the user to wear special devices. By incorporating sensors into shoes that the user already wears in everyday life, we can create a ubiquitous heart-monitoring system that follows the user around but also remains ambient in the environment. The sensors lie against the foot as part of the tongue of the shoe. The challenge is to differentiate the weak signal induced by arterial motion from the signal noise caused by musculoskeletal movement. Heart and Sole addresses this by amplifying the signal and identifying low motion points where we can more easily extract the signal. Our demo will have a demonstrator wearing a shoe with such a sensor in it, and demonstrating that their measured pulse matches up with the one being measured by our ground truth, a pulse oximeter.},

  abstract = {We present a passive and non-intrusive sensing system for monitoring hand washing activity using structural vibration sensing. Proper hand washing is one of the most effective ways to limit the spread and transmission of disease, and has been especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior approaches include direct observation and sensing-based approaches, but are limited in non-clinical settings due to operational restrictions and privacy concerns in sensitive areas such as restrooms. Our work introduces a new sensing modality for hand washing monitoring, which measures hand washing activity-induced vibration responses of sink structures, and uses those responses to monitor the presence and duration of hand washing. Primary research challenges are that vibration responses are similar for different activities, occur on different surfaces/structures, and tend to overlap/coincide. We overcome these challenges by extracting information about signal periodicity for similar activities through cepstrum-based features, leveraging hierarchical learning to differentiate activities on different surfaces, and denoting ``primary/secondary'' activities based on their relative frequency and importance. We evaluate our approach using real-world hand washing data across four different sink structures/locations, and achieve an average F1-score for hand washing activities of 0.95, which represents an 8.8X and 10.2X reduction in error over two different baseline approaches.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a structure-adaptive approach for monitoring human gait using footstep-induced floor vibrations. Human gait information is critical for timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis of many health conditions. Footstep-induced vibration monitoring has been introduced in prior works as an accurate and cost-effective mean to provide continuous gait monitoring in indoor environments. Prior works in this field typically rely on inverse modeling approaches to map signal characteristics to gait information, but are limited due to varying signal characteristics in each new deployment structure. These changing characteristics introduce errors when attempting to use a model trained in one structure in another structure. To overcome this challenge, we propose a structure-adaptive approach that enables the transfer of a model trained in one structure to a new structure where no training data is present. To this end, we first find a lower-dimension space in which vibration responses share similarity across various structures and label the data in the target structure. Then, we use the labeled data to train a new model for footstep detection and monitoring in that structure. We evaluated our approach through real-world experiments in three types of structures (wood, concrete, and steel). Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves a footstep detection accuracy of between 85 and 97 percent and F1-score of between 86 and 97 percent, which represents 3-10X and 2. 2-15X improvements over the baseline approach, respectively.},

  abstract = {Nursing is a critical activity during the lactation period of swine farming. Continuous monitoring of piglet nursing behavior during the lactation period is essential to informing animal caretakers about the health status of piglets to reduce the mortality rate, maximize lactational growth, and improve animal welfare. Traditional approaches rely on manual observation and wearable devices, which are labor-intensive and cause discomfort to the animals. Recent advancement in computer vision and ambient vibration sensing enables non-contact piglet nursing monitoring: the computer vision approach captures piglet location but has limited observation of their detailed movement due to lighting and visual obstruction constraints; the ambient vibration sensing approach captures piglet movement patterns but has limited location information. In this study, a novel approach to integrate these two complementary sensing modalities is developed for robust piglet nursing behavior monitoring during the lactation period. This study leverages the state-of-the-art Segment Anything Model (SAM) to extract the piglet location and integrate it with the piglet-induced crate vibration data to infer piglet nursing pattern and intensity, enabling robust and interpretable nursing monitoring under varying environmental and behavioral settings. The primary research challenge is the high uncertainty in piglet nursing behaviors due to the mixture of nursing and non-nursing activities from multiple piglets, leading to difficulty in identifying nursing stages. To overcome this challenge, the mixing activities are decomposed by incorporating domain knowledge of piglet nursing patterns. First, individual piglets are identified in the video data using SAM to determine nursing locations and then sample the features there to isolate the frames that are related to nursing. Next, features are extracted from crate vibrations that are representative of piglet nursing movements to further rule out the non-nursing activities. Finally, vision and vibration features are integrated together to predict piglet nursing stages. To evaluate this method, real-world deployments are conducted at a pig farm for continuous vision and vibration monitoring of 8 pens over 3 farrowing cycles. This study has a 97\% accuracy in classifying 5 nursing stages, representing a significant 3x and 3.8x error reduction compared to the baseline method using only vision or vibration data, respectively. The multi-modal fusion approach leads to a non-intrusive, robust, and interpretable piglet nursing model that can immediately inform caretakers of issues that arise during this crucial time point of a piglet's life.},

  abstract = {Heartbeat monitoring during sleep is critically important to ensuring the well-being of many people, ranging from patients to elderly. Technologies that support heartbeat monitoring should be unobtrusive, and thus solutions that are accurate and can be easily applied to existing beds is an important need that has been unfulfilled. We tackle the challenge of accurate, low-cost and easy to deploy heartbeat monitoring by investigating whether off-the- shelf analog geophone sensors can be used to detect heartbeats when installed under a bed. Geophones have the desirable property of being insensitive to lower-frequency movements, which lends itself to heartbeat monitoring as the heartbeat signal has harmonic frequencies that are easily captured by the geophone. At the same time, lower-frequency movements such as respiration, can be naturally filtered out by the geophone. With carefully-designed signal processing algorithms, we show it is possible to detect and extract heartbeats in the presence of environmental noise and other body movements a person may have during sleep. We have built a prototype sensor and conducted detailed experiments that involve 43 subjects (with IRB approval), which demonstrate that the geophone sensor is a compelling solution to long-term at-home heartbeat monitoring. We compared the average heartbeat rate estimated by our prototype and that reported by a pulse oximeter. The results revealed that the average error rate is around 1.30\% over 500 data samples when the subjects were still on the bed, and 3.87\% over 300 data samples when the subjects had different types of body movements while lying on the bed. We also deployed the prototype in the homes of 9 subjects for a total of 25 nights, and found that the average estimation error rate was 8.25\% over more than 181 hours' data.},

  abstract = {Many human activities induce excitations on ambient structures with various objects, causing the structures to vibrate. Accurate vibration excitation source detection and characterization enable human activity information inference, hence allowing human activity monitoring for various smart building applications. By utilizing structural vibrations, we can achieve sparse and non-intrusive sensing, unlike pressure- and vision-based methods. Many approaches have been presented on vibration-based source characterization, and they often either focus on one excitation type or have limited performance due to the dispersion and attenuation effects of the structures. In this paper, we present our method to characterize two main types of excitations induced by human activities (impulse and slip-pulse) on multiple structures. By understanding the physical properties of waves and their propagation, the system can achieve accurate excitation tracking on different structures without large-scale labeled training data. Specifically, our algorithm takes properties of surface waves generated by impulse and of body waves generated by slip-pulse into account to handle the dispersion and attenuation effects when different types of excitations happen on various structures. We then evaluate the algorithm through multiple scenarios. Our method achieves up to a six times improvement in impulse localization accuracy and a three times improvement in slip-pulse trajectory length estimation compared to existing methods that do not take wave properties into account.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This paper introduces an indirect train traffic monitoring method to detect and infer real-time train events based on the vibration response of a nearby building. Monitoring and characterizing traffic events are important for cities to improve the efficiency of transportation systems (e.g., train passing, heavy trucks, and traffic). Most prior work falls into two categories: (1) methods that require intensive labor to manually record events or (2) systems that require deployment of dedicated sensors. These approaches are difficult and costly to execute and maintain. In addition, most prior work uses dedicated sensors designed for a single purpose, resulting in deployment of multiple sensor systems. This further increases costs. Meanwhile, with the increasing demands of structural health monitoring, many vibration sensors are being deployed in commercial buildings. Traffic events create ground vibration that propagates to nearby building structures inducing noisy vibration responses. We present an information-theoretic method for train event monitoring using commonly existing vibration sensors deployed for building health monitoring. The key idea is to represent the wave propagation in a building induced by train traffic as information conveyed in noisy measurement signals. Our technique first uses wavelet analysis to detect train events. Then, by analyzing information exchange patterns of building vibration signals, we infer the category of the events (i.e., southbound or northbound train). Our algorithm is evaluated with an 11-story building where trains pass by frequently. The results show that the method can robustly achieve a train event detection accuracy of up to a 93\% true positive rate and an 80\% true negative rate. For direction categorization, compared with the traditional signal processing method, our information-theoretic approach reduces categorization error from 32.1 to 12.1\%, which is a 2.5{\texttimes} improvement.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating human left/right walking gait balance using footstep-induced structural vibrations. Understanding human gait balance is an integral component of assessing gait, neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, overall health status, and risk of falls. Existing techniques utilize pressure- sensing mats, wearable devices, and human observation-based assessment by healthcare providers. These existing methods are collectively limited in their operation and deployment; often requiring dense sensor deployment or direct user interaction. To address these limitations, we utilize footstep-induced structural vibration responses. Based on the physical insight that the vibration energy is a function of the force exerted by a footstep, we calculate the vibration signal energy due to a footstep and use it to estimate the footstep force. By comparing the footstep forces while walking, we determine balance. This approach enables non-intrusive gait balance assessment using sparsely deployed sensors. The primary research challenge is that the floor vibration signal energy is also significantly affected by the distance between the footstep location and the vibration sensor; this function is unclear in real-world scenarios and is a mixed function of wave propagation and structure-dependent properties. We overcome this challenge through footstep localization and incorporating structural factors into an analytical force-energy-distance function. This function is estimated through a nonlinear least squares regression analysis. We evaluate the performance of our method with a real-world deployment in a campus building. Our approach estimates footstep forces with a RMSE of 61.0N (8\% of participant's body weight), representing a 1.54X improvement over the baseline.},

  abstract = {The dataset consists of structural vibration data (vertical velocity of floor structure) induced by 10 people's footsteps as they walk around with 8 different walking speeds, sensed by 5 geophone sensors. ~ The footstep-induced structural vibration data is stored as footstep traces, each consisting of a series of consecutive footsteps (see the sample plot). The dataset is stored in a MAT-file named People.mat. The dataset includes three layers of labels: 1) person identity i (i = 1, 2, ..., 10), 2) sensor number j (j = 1, 2, ..., 5), and 3) walking speed k (k = 1, 2, ..., 8). The speed k~represents the walking speeds of {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mu,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu+{\textbackslash}sigma,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu+2{\textbackslash}sigma,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu+3{\textbackslash}sigma,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu-{\textbackslash}sigma,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu-2{\textbackslash}sigma,{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu-3{\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}), and self-selected speed by each person respectively. {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash})~and {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash})~refer to the mean and standard deviation of the step frequencies. To access the footstep traces~from the person~i, sensor j~with walking speed k, please use the MATLAB syntax People\{i\}.Sen\{j\}.S\{k\}. This gives a {\textbackslash}(m{\textbackslash}times n{\textbackslash})~cell structure.~{\textbackslash}(m{\textbackslash})~denotes the individual trace number, of which the number of traces varies from 10 to 12; {\textbackslash}(n{\textbackslash})~represents the level of amplification, including 2000X, 4000X, and 6000X, corresponding to n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3~respectively. To read and plot a sample trace of footstep-induced floor vibration, use the script read\_data.m. For more details, please refer to the original FootprintID paper in the following link: https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1145/3130954 ~ The human walking experiment involves 10 participants aged between 20 to 29 years old, of which 8 are male and 2 are female. Their walking area is 30ft X 6ft~along a hallway with concrete floor. Each of the participants wears flat bottom shoes. ~ The sensing unit consists of 5 components: 1) the geophone (SM-24), 2) the amplification module, 3) the processor board, 4) the communication module (XBee radio), and 5) the batteries. The sensing unit converts the structural vibration velocity into voltages records. The sampling frequency is 1000Hz. ~ The hardware unit, experiment setup, and a sample data plot can be found in Experiment Introduction.pdf. Further implementation details can be found in the original FootPrintID paper in the link above. ~ Please cite this dataset as: ~ Yiwen Dong, Shijia Pan, Tong Yu, Mostafa Mirshekari, Jonathon Fagert, Amelie Bonde, Ole J.
