Welcome to the GeoMCU documentation!
====================================

**GeoMCU** is an interface for `geophone elements <https://www.seis-tech.com/sm-24-equivalent-geophone-sensor/>`_, enabling them to be organized into sensor networks for structural vibration sensing tasks, including:

* Structural Health Monitoring
* Human and Animal Activity Detection
* Vitals Monitoring, such as Heart Rate and Respiration
* Footstep Detection

The project includes the interface PCB design (See :doc:`/hardware/index`), firmware code, and a :doc:`/gateway/index`.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information or jump to specific sections on how to use each part of the system.
